## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
This project was done as part of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree coursework. In it, I explore the 2019 and 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, with the goal of create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind in oder to create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience

For this project, I was interestested in a better understanding of:


The ratio between men and women in the software developers comunity in Spain.

On the other hand and with a general interest I would like to know preferences and subjective experiences of people in the workforce. 

And Finally I also would like to know if there is a relationship between the level of influence over new technology purchase and the worker satisfaction within a organization.

Because of this I will try to respond these three questions to explore in my investigation:

#### Question #1: Which is the ratio between men and women in 2020? Which is the variation respect to the previous year?

#### Question #2: Python vs Java: Does the age of developers influence which programming languages they know or want to learn?

#### Question #3: People with higher influence over the technology purchase show higher satisfaction than people with less influence?

## File Descriptions
The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available here. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
